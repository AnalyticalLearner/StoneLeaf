## StoneLeaf New Operator FAQ

Q: What is StoneLeaf?
A: StoneLeaf is a decentralized, offline-first knowledge archive. Each “node” is a library anyone can run—like monks copying scrolls or WWII radio ops keeping the signal alive.

Q: Why should I run a node?
A: To resist deletion, preserve memory, and keep knowledge free from centralized control. Your node makes you a steward of culture, not just a consumer.

Q: Isn’t this just file sharing?
A: File sharing without philosophy is piracy. StoneLeaf is stewardship: you’re curating knowledge for your family, community, and future generations.

Q: What do I need to start?
A: A computer (even modest), some storage space, and the starter kit. No cloud, no central server. You are the server.

Q: How do I decide what to store?
A: Think like an archivist. Preserve texts, tools, and guides that strengthen resilience, culture, and knowledge. Each library should be unique, like a vinyl collection.

Q: What if my archive has errors or bad info?
A: That’s part of human stewardship. Unlike centralized platforms, StoneLeaf doesn’t hide bias. You curate, compare, and update. Archivists sharpen their minds by engaging, not outsourcing judgment.

Q: Is StoneLeaf legal?
A: Yes. You are preserving knowledge, not stealing it. However, you are responsible for your collection—just like any personal library.

Q: Can my node connect with others?
A: Yes, nodes can trade and sync like ham radio operators swapping signals. But StoneLeaf works even if you’re fully offline.

Q: How does StoneLeaf defend against AI or Big Tech criticism?
A: They’ll call it “redundant,” “unmoderated,” or “fringe.” But remember: centralized control doesn’t remove propaganda—it monopolizes it. StoneLeaf keeps memory plural, local, and human.

Q: What’s my role as an Archivist?
A: To run your node with pride, share your collection, talk about it, and pass it on. You’re part of the Republic of Memory.
