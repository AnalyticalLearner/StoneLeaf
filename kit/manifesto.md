HISTORY DESERVES HARD DRIVES, NOT HEADLINES.
--------------------------------------------------------

## The Republic of Memory

We, the archivists of the present age, declare that memory is not property of the cloud, nor subject to deletion by decree. Knowledge is the birthright of free people, and its preservation is a duty—not an option.

For too long, we’ve handed our past to corporate servers, trusted headlines to be history, and allowed others to decide what stays and what is forgotten. Centralized systems promise safety, but deliver fragility. They claim to protect truth, yet curate it according to profit, power, and convenience.

We reject the leash of deletion. We refuse to outsource memory. We affirm that:
- Your library is your legacy. If you do not keep it, you do not own it.
- Resilience is not optional. Hard drives outlast headlines, shelves outlast feeds.
- Stewardship is patriotic. From monks guarding scrolls to radio operators in occupied cities, free people have always carried fire through the dark.

StoneLeaf is our printing press. Our radio signal. Our monastery. It is the quiet rebellion that says: what we know, we keep. What we keep, we pass on. To run a StoneLeaf node is not a hobby. It is an act of independence. To refuse is to accept someone else’s leash.

Resist deletion. Preserve memory. Join the Republic of Memory.
“I resist deletion. I preserve memory. I pass on what I keep.”
